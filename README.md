## INFO 343 Expanding Your Toolbox Assignment

In this assignment, I utilized the data visualization library called [chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/).  

### Why Chart.js?

Chart.js is a powerful tool that uses the HTML5 canvas element to create simple and lightweight graphs and charts to visualize data within your websites or applications.  Data can tell lots of information, but it must be shown in an organized and clear manner, or else it becomes overwhelming for the audience.  Chart.js helps to solve this by providing simple and interactive templates to express your data with.

### Some benefits & drawbacks

Chart.js is kept to date with HTML5 and is supported in all modern browswers.  It's fairly easy to use this library and the documentation is very helpful.  

However, one of the drawbacks is the lack of variety in graph templates that chart.js provides.  There are only a total of six that can be used, though they can be customized to fit your needs very well if you utilize the options available.

### About this example
In this example, I used chart.js to help visualize personal information that many people use everyday into a readable manner.  It's a mock-up version of a personal dashboard, with information pertaining to local weather, calorie intake for the day, and hours spent throughout the day (with relation to yesterday).  Though this information can usually be found or recorded on your own, it helps to have it described in a visual form to understand even more, such as patterns, trends, and relationships about these bits of everyday information.  In order to use this example, you only need to download the files within the repository, as all of the scripts and libraries are provided.

### Resources
Chart.js is a popular library, with several tutorials and examples to learn about how to use it.  You can start by reading up on its easy-to-follow [documentation](http://www.chartjs.org/docs).  

There are more tutorials you can find, such as this one by [Tuts+](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/build-a-dynamic-dashboard-with-chartjs--webdesign-14363).

And many other beautiful examples are created by other developers to view [here](http://devpost.com/software/built-with/chart-js)
